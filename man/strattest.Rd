\description{
Conducts two chi-squared tests for the consistency of the
  Petersen-type abundance estimator.  These tests provide explore evidence
  against equal capture probabilities in either the first or second sampling
  event.

  Typically, if either of these test p-values is greater than the
  significance level, use of a Petersen-type estimator is considered
  justified.  If both tests give evidence of unequal capture probabilities
  between strata, a stratified estimator should be used, such as \link{Nstrat}.

  This function assumes stratification in both sampling events, such that
  individuals cannot move from one strata to another (such as by size or
  gender).  If movement between strata may occur (such as in the case of
  stratification by time or area), use of \link{consistencytest} is
  recommended.
}
\note{
Any Petersen-type estimator (such as this) depends on a set of
  assumptions: \itemize{ \item  The population is closed; that is, that there
  are no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration between sampling events
  \item All individuals have the same probability of capture in one of the
  two events, or complete mixing occurs between events \item Marking in the
  first event does not affect probability of recapture in the second event
  \item Individuals do not lose marks between events \item All marks will be
  reported in the second event }
